# multiplepdf
The project focuses on developing an advanced chatbot capable of handling multiple 
PDF documents using cutting-edge open-source technologies. It utilizes Sentence 
Transformers to generate text embeddings for semantic understanding, Faiss CPU 
for efficient vector storage and similarity search, and the Mistral-7b(as of now for users over the internet GPT-2)  model 
to enhance natural language processing capabilities. The chatbot is designed to offer 
a dynamic conversational interface built with Streamlit, making it user-friendly and 
practical. Initially, a demo will be created using Google Colab, leveraging its free 
computational resources. This will then transition into a full-fledged Streamlit 
application, enabling efficient information retrieval from PDF documents in a smart, 
accessible manner.
